      <h2>Shrek: The Reluctant Hero</h2>
      <p>Shrek is a complex character who defies traditional fairy tale stereotypes. As an ogre, he is initially portrayed as grumpy, solitary, and intimidating, living in a swamp away from society. However, beneath his rough exterior lies a kind-hearted and loyal individual who values friendship and family. Shrek's journey throughout the film reveals his growth from a self-centered recluse to a compassionate hero who learns to embrace his true self. His character challenges the notion of beauty and heroism, showing that true worth comes from within rather than outward appearances.</p>
