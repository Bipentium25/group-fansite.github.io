# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*

# Priscilla
(All I need is access to the internet, a laptop and be able to communicate with my teammates. (There's a slack group chat where we can reach out to each other.))

# Nadia
(I need a stable internet connection, my laptop, and access to our shared GitHub repo and Slack channel for communication.)

# Xin Li
(insert your answer here)

# Mengqiao Han
(A shared git repository and slack for communication. )

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

# Priscilla
(I personally like when we can work togheter at the same time (live), but since this is a bigger group and I think it would be fine to work separately and then discuss about our approaches.)

# Nadia
(I think it’s great if we can start by coding together to align on structure and logic, then divide tasks so we can work independently and later review each other’s code.
I’m comfortable using GitHub for collaboration and Slack/Zoom for communication and quick check-ins.)

# Xin Li
(insert your answer here)

# Mengqiao Han
(I prefer that we each work on our part seperately and then come together to share our ideas and help each other to get a uniformed result. )



## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*

# Nadia: 
I like to take a few minutes to think through a problem before discussing.

# Priscilla 
 I learn by doing, but I agree with Nadia I also like to read through the problem and think about it before sharing my thoughts. I also like to hear other people's understanding of the problem.

# Xin Li
(insert your answer here)

# Mengqiao Han
(I want to try out everything first and then help each other to solve the problems we each encounter. )

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*

# Priscilla
I prefer straightfoward feedback. Just be honest and direct!

# Nadia
(I appreciate clear and specific feedback that includes examples or suggestions for improvement. I prefer feedback to be kind but direct, whether written in a PR comment or discussed briefly during meetings.)

# Xin Li
(insert your answer here)

# Mengqiao Han
I prefer very direct feedback. 

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*

# Priscilla: 
I'd love to practice clear comunication!

# Nadia
(I’d like to keep improving my ability to explain technical ideas clearly in English — to practice using precise programming vocabulary when discussing code or problem-solving.)

# Xin Li
(insert your answer here)

# Mengqiao Han
(I want to practice on sharing workload. Unlike previous projects where we each need to understand the whole logic, this time with the html we can each work on a separate part. )

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*

Let’s be flexible with scheduling, keep communication transparent, and support each other’s learning pace.
